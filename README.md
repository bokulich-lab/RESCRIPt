REference Sequence annotation and CuRatIon Pipeline

**Note:** This is a beta release. Usage, and other details are forthcoming. See citation information below.

RESCRIPt is a python 3 package to support a variety of operations for managing and curating reference sequence databases, DNA/RNA sequence data, and taxonomic data.

## Install from source

RESCRIPt will be installable as conda package in the near future. In the meantime, we provide a source installation.

First create a conda environment and install relevant dependencies (you can skip this step and install RESCRIPt in a conda environment containing QIIME 2 2020.2+, which should contain the necessary dependencies/versions):

```
conda create -y -n rescript
conda activate rescript
conda install \
  -c conda-forge -c bioconda -c qiime2 -c defaults \
  qiime2 q2cli q2templates q2-types q2-longitudinal q2-feature-classifier "pandas>=0.25.3" xmltodict
```

Finally install from source:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/bokulich-lab/RESCRIPt.git
```

To view a help menu for using rescript via the QIIME 2 CLI:
```
qiime dev refresh-cache
qiime --help
```

## Using RESCRIPt

These tutorials demonstrate some of the basic functionality of RESCRIPt, via the q2CLI (QIIME 2 command-line interface):
